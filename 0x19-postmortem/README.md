## Task 0

Using one of the web stack debugging project issue or an outage you have personally face, write a postmortem. Most of you will never have faced an outage, so just get creative and invent your own :)

## Task 1

We are constantly stormed by a quantity of information, itâ€™s tough to get people to read you.

Make your post-mortem attractive by adding humour, a pretty diagram or anything that would catch your audience attention.

Please, remember that these blogs must be written in English to further your technical ability in a variety of settings.
